# Security issues found after pull
Authentication
❌ High Risk: Mock authentication in 
AuthContext.tsx
 must be replaced with Supabase Auth
❌ High Risk: JWT validation and session management not implemented

Authorization
⚠️ Medium Risk: Role-based access control exists but lacks server-side validation
⚠️ High Risk: Missing Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
⚠️ High Risk: No permission validation on API endpoints
Data Protection
❌ High Risk: Missing encryption for sensitive data at rest
❌ High Risk: No audit logging for sensitive operations
❌ High Risk: Input validation and sanitization not implemented
API Security
❌ High Risk: API endpoints not found in the expected location
❌ High Risk: Missing input validation on all endpoints
❌ High Risk: No API versioning strategy
Frontend Security
❌ High Risk: Missing CSRF protection
❌ Medium Risk: Error messages may leak sensitive information
❌ Medium Risk: No Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

## Purpose
This document tracks critical security fixes and code quality improvements needed before production deployment. Each item is marked with `[ ]` and should be checked off with `[x]` once completed. This ensures we maintain a clear record of security-related work and can verify all critical issues are addressed.

## Immediate Security Fixes

### Authentication
- [x] Replace mock authentication in `AuthContext.tsx` with Supabase Auth
- [ ] Implement proper JWT validation and session management
- [ ] Add rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement secure password policies
- [ ] Add session timeout and automatic logout

### Authorization
- [ ] Implement server-side permission validation for all API endpoints
- [ ] Configure Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Add proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Implement role-based access control on the server-side
- [ ] Add permission checks for all sensitive operations

### Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement proper CSRF protection
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

### API Security
- [ ] Implement proper API endpoint structure
- [ ] Add input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Implement API versioning
- [ ] Add request/response validation
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration

### Frontend Security
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Implement secure error handling
- [ ] Add security headers
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add client-side input validation

## Code Quality Improvements

### Type Safety
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for all API responses
- [ ] Implement runtime validation with Zod or similar
- [ ] Add type guards for API responses
- [ ] Fix any TypeScript errors/warnings
- [ ] Add proper type definitions for all components

### Error Handling
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed requests
- [ ] Add proper error messages for users
- [ ] Log errors appropriately

### Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for security-critical components
- [ ] Implement integration tests for authentication flows
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline with security scanning

### Code Organization
- [ ] Organize API routes consistently
- [ ] Add proper documentation for components
- [ ] Implement consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Remove unused code and dependencies
- [ ] Add proper code comments

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All security fixes implemented
- [ ] All code quality improvements completed
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed

## Notes
- Each item should be checked off only after thorough testing
- Security fixes should be prioritized over features
- Document any security assumptions or limitations
- Keep this file updated as new issues are discovered
